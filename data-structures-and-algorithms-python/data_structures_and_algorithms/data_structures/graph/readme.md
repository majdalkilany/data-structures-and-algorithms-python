# graph 


## ## Challenge
to create graph Class and methods 

### Features

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:


* AddNode() Adds a new node to the graph Takes 
in the value of that node Returns the added 
node
* AddEdge() Adds a new edge between two nodes 
in the graph Include the ability to have a 
“weight” Takes in the two nodes to be 
connected by the edge Both nodes should 
already be in the Graph
* GetNodes() Returns all of the nodes in the 
graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)
* GetNeighbors() Returns a collection of 
edges connected to the given node Takes in a 
given node Include the weight of the 
connection in the returned collection
* Size() Returns the total number of nodes in 
the graph
