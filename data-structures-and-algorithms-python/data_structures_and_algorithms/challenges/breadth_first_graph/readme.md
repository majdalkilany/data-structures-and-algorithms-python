## description
breadth first, top down lwft to right, queue a root/start, when it is 
dequeued, enqueue its children. because this is a graph, check if the 
child/neighbor/edge has been visited already.




## Challenge
to make breadth first traversal for grapphs 

## Approach & Efficiency
loops (for) 
if statment 
 

#### big o(n)
